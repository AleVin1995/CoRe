\title{Adaptive Daisy Model to compute core fitness genes}
\usage{
CoRe.ADaM(depMat,
          display=TRUE,
          main_suffix='fitness genes in at least 1 cell line',
          xlab='n. dependent cell lines',
          ntrials=1000,
          verbose=TRUE,
          TruePositives)
}
\arguments{
\item{depMat}{Binary dependency matrix, rows are genes and columns are samples (screens, cell-cell lines). A 1 in position \emph{[i,j]} indicates that inactivation of the \emph{i}-th gene exerts a significant loss of fitness in the \emph{j}-th sample, 0 otherwise.}

\item{display}{Boolean, default is TRUE. Should bars indicating dependency profiles and boxes for estimated null models be plotte.}

\item{main_suffix}{If display=TRUE, title suffix to be give to the plots.}

\item{xlab}{label to be used in the x-axis of the plots, default is 'n. cell lines'.}

\item{ntrials}{Integer, default =1000. How many times to randomly perturb dependency matrix to generate null distributions of number of genes called essentials in fixed number of cell lines.}
\item{verbose}{Boolean, default is TRUE. Should the computation progress be monitored.}
\item{TruePositives}{Vector of gene symbols to be used as reference prior known essential genes.}
}
\value{
\item{coreFitnessGenes}{A vector of strings with estimated Core Fitness Genes' symbols.}
}
\description{
This function estimates Core Fitness essential genes using the Adaptive Daisy Model [1] starting from a binary gene dependency matrix.
}
\details{
This function identifies Core Fitness essential genes from the joint analysis of multiple CRISPR-Cas9 viability screens performed on different cell-lines / models. It works with binary gene x cell-line essantial/non-essential matrices and it estimates the minimal number \eqn{n} of cell-lines in which a gene should be called as essential in order to be considered as a core-fitness essential gene for the tissue of origin of the screened cell-lines. This threshold is computed in a semi-supervised way and it is defined as that maximising the deviance from expectation of the number of genes that are essential in \eqn{n} cell-lines and their
true positive rates computed with respect to a set of prior known core-fitness essential genes (to be provided in input).
