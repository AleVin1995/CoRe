\usage{
CoRe.tradeoffEO_TPR(EO,
                    TPR,
                    test_set_name,
                    display = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{EO}{Profile of empirical odds values. Computed with the \code{CoRe.empiricalOdds} function.}

\item{TPR}{Profile of True positive rates across number of cell line. Computed with the \code{CoRe.truePositiveRate} function.}

\item{test_set_name}{Name to give to the analysis, used for plotting titles.}
\item{display}{Boolean, default is TRUE. Should ADaM plots be produced.}
}
\value{
ADAM model threshold:
\item{point}{Number of cell lines for which a gene needs to be a significant fitness gene in order to be predicted as core-fitness gene.}
}
\description{
This function is used by the ADaM method [1] to identify the minimum number of cell lines in which a gene needs to be fitness in order to be called core-fitness for all the cell lines analysed by ADaM. This is defined as the \emph{n} providing the best trade-off between i) coverage of priori-known essential genes in the resulting set of predicted core-fitness genes, i.e. fitness in at least \emph{n} cell lines, and ii) deviance from expectation of the number of fitness genes in at least \emph{n} cell lines.
}
\details{
Compare and plot the curve of log10 odds ratios with the true positive rate curve, across all tested \emph{n} value, to find the cross over point.
